# Chatbot WhatsApp 

Hi, this is the whatsapp chatbot implementation for Bureau of Academic and Student Administration of Politeknik Caltex Riau from <a href="https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js">whatsapp-web.js</a> by Pedro S. Lopez

## Important thing!

As because Whatsapp regularly makes an update, so we needs to always **use the latest version of whatsapp-web.js**. Some errors may occurs with the old versions, so please try to update the library version before creating an issue.

### How to use?

- Clone or download this repo
- import the sql file to your DBMS(such as phpmyadmin)
- Enter to the project directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start:dev`
- Open browser and go to address `http://localhost:8000`
- Scan the QR Code by Whatsapp application
- Enjoy!
